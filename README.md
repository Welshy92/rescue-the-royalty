## **User Experience (UX)**
 
### Initial Discussion
 
Rescue The Royalty at its core is a very basic version of what you would expect to see in the combat of a classic turn based JRPG game. It contains a few basic mechanics, such as HP, various attacks (some can do double, half or no damage at all depending on the enemy the user faces), and a basic healing spell. The aim is using a combination of attacks and healing to defeat the enemy before it defeats you. The game contains various random elements to keep the player guessing and offer some replayability.
 
### **User Stories**
 
#### Client Goals
 
* To be able to view and interact with the site on multiple different devices.
* To have the need for strategizing their choices to win the fights.
* To be able to see how many wins or defeats they have during their current play session.
* To be able to view the enemy and hero stats during combat.
 
#### First Time Visitor Goals
 
* I want to know how the game works.
* I want to test my strategic mind.
* I want to know how best to defeat my enemies.
 
#### Returning Visitor Goals
 
* I want to further challenge myself.
* I want to view my hero or enemies stats.

## **Design**
 
### **Colour Scheme**
 
![My original chosen colour scheme](/assets/images/colour-scheme.png)
 
My colour scheme is inspired by the old CGA displays.
 
### **Typography**
 
[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used for the following fonts:
* Roboto Mono
* SilkScreen
 
[Font Awesome]() was used for the down arrow icons used.
 
### **Imagery**
 
All images were created by myself using [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/welshynator).
 
Footer icons modified from the associated websites logos by myself using Paint.NET.
 
### **Wireframes**
 
Wireframes created using Balsamiq.

### **Features**
 
### **Future Implementations**
 
* Add a game reset button that takes you back to the start screen so the user doesn't need to fully refresh the page.
* Add animation and optional sound/music to the game.
 
### **Accessibility**
 
While coding this site I have been mindful to ensure that the website is accessible and friendly. I have achieved this by:
  * Using descriptive alt attributes on all images used.
  * Making sure that there is sufficient colour contrast throughout the entire site.
  * Use semantic HTML where possible.
