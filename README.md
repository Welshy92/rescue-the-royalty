## **User Experience (UX)**
 
### Initial Discussion
 
Rescue The Royalty at it's core is a very basic version of what you would expect to see in the combat of a classic turn based JRPG game. It contains a few basic mechancis, such as HP, various attacks (some can do double, half or no damage at all dependant on the enemy the user faces), and a basic healing spell. The aim is using a combination of attacks and healing to defeat the enemy before it defeats you. The game contains various random elements to keep the playing guessing and offer some replayablility.
