            <p>You will be facing off against 1 of 6 potential enemies (chosen at random). It is a fight to the death so you must make sure the enemies hitpoints (HP for short) hits 0 before yours does! You will take it in turns to fight, starting with your move first. During your turn you have 6 options to chose from. A physical attack known as "Sword Swing", an attack for each of the 4 elements and a healing spell that will give you back some HP. At the start of each fight you will be assigned 1 random weakness and 1 random resistance. Each enemy has a type of attack that they are reisitant to which will cause your damage for that attack to be cut in half. Some enemies can also nullify certain types of attacks which will cause it to do no damage. Each enemy also has 1 weakness that will cause you do deal double damage. See the chart and table below for more information on what element is good to use and some information on each potiential enemy you can encounter.</p>
