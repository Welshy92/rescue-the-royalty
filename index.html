            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>It is a fight to the death! So you must make sure the enemies hit points (HP for short) hits 0 before yours does! You will take it in turns to fight, starting with your move first. You have 5 damaging attacks and 1 heal. At the start of each fight you will be assigned 1 random weakness and 1 random resistance. Each enemy has a type of attack that they are resistant to which will cause your damage for that attack to be cut in half. Some enemies can also nullify certain types of attacks which will cause it to do no damage. Each enemy also has 1 weakness that will cause you to deal double damage. See the chart and table below for more information on what element is good to use. More detailed info for each enemy can be found by pressing the "Info" button in game.</p>
